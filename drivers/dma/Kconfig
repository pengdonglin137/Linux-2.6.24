	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.

	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine present
	  in recent Intel Xeon chipsets.

	  Say Y here if you have such a chipset.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Enable support for the Intel(R) IOP Series RAID engines.

	help
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.
